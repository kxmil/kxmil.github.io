          <p>This project was conceived in a collective research project that ended up in an mixed media experience.
            <br><br>The installation consists of two parts. The first is a narrative scenography presenting visuals and research documents to establish our universe. These are fictional narratives mixed with real scientific facts. The second is the one with the <i>Amphorae</i> accompanied by projections (an interactive participatory installation).</p>

          <p>LV55 is a collective of designers and researchers interested in three key concepts - living, human and machine - gathering around language. At the beginning of our reflection, we wanted to create a more natural and lively interface to detach from screens, which is why we chose water as an interface substance. We have a strong connection with this element, particularly a sensory relationship.
          <br><br>We began experimenting with water, wanting to make it an interactive device, recreating existing devices with a different substance. We were quickly limited by our skills and technical means, so we turned to fiction design, freeing us from technical constraints and feasibility. We still have the desire to create a tangible and interactive object, imagining its function and story linked to water.
          <br><br>We developed an interface that communicates between humans and water, using the machine as a mediator, to reflect on new, more sensitive and lively relationships with water. One of our main inspirations was "Bodies of Water" by <a href="https://g.co/kgs/yHeLYm" target="_blank">Astrida Neimanis</a>, which imagines a new common identity for living/non-living, human/non-human, around our aqueous composition (which she calls biological water).</p>
