          <h3>wireframing</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>In the wireframing phase for Emoby, we meticulously crafted an intuitive interface for seamlessly retrieving data from various sources, ensuring that the system could access diverse CV databases with ease. We also implemented a robust profile matching interface, leveraging advanced algorithms to precisely align candidate profiles with specific job descriptions and skills, thereby simplifying the talent acquisition process.</p>
            <img src="/img/wire.png" />
            <p><br/>To further enhance user experience, we developed a sophisticated mechanism for HR professionals to efficiently shortlist CVs, streamlining the selection process and saving valuable time while ensuring that only the most qualified candidates were considered.</p>

            <p>We built a PoC based on wireframe to be able to test it with the users. Tests data report for Emoby reveals essential insights for the platform's development. The tests aimed to gather feedback to enhance the matching algorithm and gather user feedback to align Emoby more closely with user needs. The sample included various profiles, from managers to recruitment specialists, reflecting the diverse user base. The feedback and modification suggestions provided valuable input for refining the user interface and interaction design. Data from the tests also showed promising statistics, indicating strong user engagement, making Emoby a promising solution in the field of talent acquisition.</p>

          <h3>outcome</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>In 6 months, we built a technology capable of converting candidate CV databases into searchable semantic spaces in a matter of seconds.
              <br/><br/>This allows human resources professionals to:
              <br/>• Search for profiles in a database of CVs supported by artificial intelligence from a need formulated in a job description
              <br/>• Automatically generate skill and job maps</p>
