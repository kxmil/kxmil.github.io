            <p>For this workshop in collaboration with Mentalista Studio, the project was to create an electronic sport controlled by the mind. Mentalista developped a Brain-Interface technology that able us to monitor brain waves and use it as an API. </p>

          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>The aim of this workshop was to design an experience where players compete only with their strength of concentration.</p>
            <p>- How might we translate the energy produced by the mind into something visually as powerful?</p>
            <p>- How might we make something estetically stimulant?</p>
            <p>- How might we define an efficient workflow to build the experience in less than 5 days?</p>

          <h3>The concept</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>Fast & Focus is a futuristic arcade time-trial racing video game inspired by the gameplay of TrackMania and WipEout. The player controls the speed of a vehicle by thought.</p>
            <p>The gameplay is based on the control of an anti-gravitational vehicle, the aim of which is to progress in a straight line to the finish ramp as quickly as possible. The more intense the player's brain activity, the faster the vehicle moves.</p>

          <h3>game design</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>To create this game, we used the video game creation and real-time 3D software: Unreal Engine. We based our methodology on the model of a video game studio. This model enabled us to optimize the 5 days and nights of production available to us. We precisely defined roles and tasks adapted to our skills to enable us to make simultaneous progress on aspects of the game before proceeding with final assembly. </p>

          <h3>tasks division</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>As the project leader, my part of the work was mainly to coordinate the work of the team. However, while Kélit developed the skeleton of the game and its mechanisms, I was also in charge of connecting the Brain-Interface Technology with Unreal Engine.</p>
            <img src="/img/ue1.png" />
            <p><br>Meanwhile, Matteo was responsible for the graphic design and modeling of the vehicle on Blender, he also took care of the sound design inspired by video game music and industrial/warehouse techno.</p>
            <img src="/img/vehicle.png" />
            <p><br>Finally, Axel and Faustine worked as a duo on the creation of the environment, one on the modeling of the tunnel and futuristic cityscapes, the other on textures and the animated shaders that give that special luminous ambience.</p>

          <h3>graphic design</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>The identity of anti-gravity racing games is marked by a technological and futuristic aesthetic, and we felt it was important to integrate these codes into the Fast & Focus graphic identity. We were largely inspired by The Designers Republic studio, famous for the visual creation of the wipEout games, and the Warp Records label.</p>
            <img src="/img/ig2.png" />
            <p><br>The color code is illustrative of the 90s techno scene, and the technical, rounded typography is typical of futuristic aesthetics, epitomized by artists such as Björk, Aphex Twin and the movies Blade Runner and Tron. The main font is Venue, designed for the anti-gravity racing game F-Zero GX released in 2003.</p>
            <img src="/img/menu.png" />
            <p><br>We also incorporated reminders of the competitive sports aesthetic, creating fictitious sponsors to dress up the racing machine's body. The Fast & Focus logo follows the shape of the vehicle.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="subsection">
          <h3>gameplay</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>To create this new mental sport, we decided to use the concept of a time trial, we're using a recipe that's already very popular in e-sports, placing the competitive instinct at the heart of the experience.</p>
            <img src="/img/map.png" />
            <p><br>The use of our brains as a medium for direct interaction with digital interfaces is still in its early stages, so we've put in place a simple use of Mentalista technology, bridging speed and focusing. This concentration is aided by visual and audio immersion, as the player passes through a hypnotic lighted tunnel, stimulated by techno music that eases the player into a state of meditation.</p>
            <img src="/img/test.png" />
            <p><br>The player progresses through a seemingly complex environment, but realizes that he can only go straight ahead. A counter informs him that the race is timed, the driver who finishes the race is propelled by a final launch pad and discovers the statistics of his performance, recorded as the best time if he has broken the record. The game then automatically prepares to welcome the next challenger.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="subsection">
          <h3>reflection</h3>
          <div class="subsection-content">
            <p>We were confident that the game has the potential to evolve into a virtual reality experience, with the idea of enhancing the sense of immersion and focusing. However, within the 5 days sprint, it was out of our capabilities to have a stable prototype for this deadline even if we managed to test it once with an Oculus Quest.</p>
            <img src="/img/ig1.png" />
            <p><br>It was the first time that I lead a project with 5 people, it was super instructive to be in this role, I enjoyed being the link between team members and combining each individual work into the final game. Special thank to Kélit and his commitment, with whom I pulled some all-nighters to finish the prototype.</p>
            <p>It's one of my favorite projects, and I'm looking to work again on this kind of technology.</p>
